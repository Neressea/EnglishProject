So, we saw in the previous part that we didn't manage to implement all the features we wanted to do (like administrators rights, usage of the forgetting curve, and more flexible forms). However, we succeeded in doing the key features of this project and we think that it is sufficient to already provide a nice experience to the user.

Besides of what we have done, this project allowed us to learn new technologies like jQuery and bootstrap, and to improve our skills in the other technologies we already knew like python, Jinja2, and straight JTML, CSS and javascript. We also had to put ourselves in the place of the user, and it was really a complicated exercise to think about everything. To have several opinions, we also asked our acquaintances to try it and tell us what they thought about it.

As a conclusion, we think that this project was a great opportunity to explore new programming tools, and to create a real-size website during several months.
